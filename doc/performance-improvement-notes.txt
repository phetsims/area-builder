This document is mostly for an internal development record.  It captures notes
on the effort to improve performance prior to publication.

Published version 1.0.0.dev.16 as a performance baseline.  The main issues at
this point are:
1. Animation for showing solutions for 'built it' style game challenges is a
bit chunky in high performance environments (Win7 + Chrome 37) and intolerably
slow in lower-performance environments, such as on iPad 2.
2. Dragging of single squares gets progressively slower as more shapes are
added to the board on some platforms.  The effect is not nearly as bad on
Win7+Chrome or Win7 + IE - in fact it's hard to even notice, but it can be
seen on Win7+Firefox.  On OSX on a Macbook Pro (Dirac was the actual machine I
used to test it), the effect wasn't noticeable on Chrome, but was definitely
there on Safari. The test is to go to the first screen, build a 3x3 stack of
shapes in the lower right corner, then pull a shape from the bucket and
release it at the upper left corner of the board.
