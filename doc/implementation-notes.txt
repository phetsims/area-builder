The model is designed using screen coordinates as the size so that no model-
view transform is needed.

PropertySet is used for model objects with two or more properties.

In this sim, 'self' is being tried out as the way to make 'this' persistent
and thus usable in closures, rather than 'thisModel', 'thisScreen' and so
forth.

There is a pervasive concept in the code that is called "Placement Boards".
These are conceptually like real world poster boards or bulletin boards, where
items can be stuck on them and removed from them.

Another central concept is that of a perimeter, which is a shape that is
defined by an ordered set of points, with straight lines being drawn between
the points.
