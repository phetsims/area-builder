Description of the model used in Area Builder

For the most part, the model is very straightforward.  The calculated area for
a given shape is equal to the number of unit squares that it would cover.  For
perimeter, the total perimeter includes both interior and exterior perimeters,
so a shape that has missing pieces inside of it will have a longer perimeter
than one that is the same overall size but has no missing interior pieces.
